Heart Disease Prediction with Python (Machine Learning project).
I would like to explain you the procedure which are going to follow for completed this project.

First step is get heart prediction data from Kaggle. so this data set contains several health parameters which corresponds to a person's healthiness of the heart. Firstly, I need to process this data set to make it fit and compatible for machine learning algorithm to learn. So once process the data need to split the data into training data and testing data.

Often train machine learning algorithm with training data and evaluate model to the performance of model using the test data and this parts is called as train test split where we split original data into training data and testing data.

Once do that training data to machine learning model. I'm used to a logistic regression model. this particular used case is a binary classification. Classify whether a person has a heart disease or not.
Binary classification either yes or no kind of questions and in that binary classification logistic regression model is very useful in that project. 

Once I train this logistic regression model with training data I want to some evaluate model to check its performance. So, after that I trained logistic regression model and to this model I'm feed new data in model. So the predict whether that person has heart disease or not, So this is I'm done with this project using Machine Learning with python.
